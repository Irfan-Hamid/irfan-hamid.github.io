**Non-Self-Referential Attention in Transformers**

<details>
<summary>View Details</summary>

â€¢ Explored modifications to Transformer architecture and developed a method called Non-Self-Referential Attention  
â€¢ Driven by the observation that self-attention values (main diagonal of the attention matrix) were often disproportionately high yet minimally informative, this method attenuated those values by a tunable factor to diversify attention distributions and improve performance on tasks like machine translation  
â€¢ Applied this approach to the 'en-pt' translation subset of the opus_books dataset, achieving a 2.12% BLEU score improvement

<details>
<summary>View Details</summary>

â€¢ Extracted and preprocessed text from PDF textbooks, formatted it into chunks and converted them into numerical embeddings  
â€¢ Designed a vector-based retrieval system to identify and extract relevant text chunks based on user queries  
â€¢ Generated context-aware prompts using retrieved passages and utilized LLM (Google/GEMMA-7B-it) to produce accurate, context-driven responses to queries derived from textbook content

<details>
<summary>View Details</summary>

â€¢ Tackles multi-label classification where each sample has only a single positive label  
â€¢ Applies to real-world cases like species distribution modeling (SDM), where only presence data is available  
â€¢ Introduces a custom loss function called UPL (Up-weighting Positive Label), enabling better handling of partial labels  
â€¢ Achieved a 72% improvement in performance over standard binary cross-entropy loss

<details>
<summary>View Details</summary>

â€¢ Compared classical ML (Random Forest, SVM) and deep learning (AlexNet) under real-world image perturbations  
â€¢ Used the Sports Balls Multiclass Image Classification dataset (Kaggle, 9,000+ images across 15 classes)  
â€¢ Applied distortions like noise, occlusion, brightness/contrast changes  
â€¢ AlexNet demonstrated superior robustness and generalization
