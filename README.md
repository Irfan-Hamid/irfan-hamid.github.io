## üíº Work Experience {#work-experience}

### Forest Research, Student Researcher _(Mar 2024 ‚Äì Aug 2024)_  
*(The research agency of the Forestry Commission, UK government)*  
‚Ä¢ Conducted an industry-partnered machine learning research with Forest Research (the research agency of the Forestry Commission, UK government) for my MSc dissertation, focusing on the classification of tree species in the Forest of Dean using high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery from Planet Labs‚Äô SuperDove 8 satellites  
‚Ä¢ Implemented and trained deep learning models, including ResNet-34, DenseNet-40 and Vision Transformers (ViT) to perform species classification. Utilized QGIS for geospatial preprocessing, spatial analysis, and visualization of labelled tree data  
‚Ä¢ Performed a comparative evaluation of the models and analyzed classification accuracy across various tree species. Additionally, examined species spectral curves to understand and explain model predictions, highlighting the strengths and limitations in classification performance, contributing to advancements in precise forestry and remote sensing applications

### Wipro Limited, SAP BW Consultant, Chennai, India _(Jul 2021 ‚Äì Jun 2023)_  
‚Ä¢ Designed and optimized SAP BW process chains for the client, Nomad Foods Europe Limited, leading to improved automation and data integration. Enhanced data loading efficiency and reduced manual intervention by developing models using Advanced DataStore Objects (aDSO) and composite providers, ensuring timely and reliable data availability  
‚Ä¢ Developed customized SAP BW queries to meet Nomad Foods' reporting needs, resulting in more accurate, actionable insights. Enabled real-time data analysis for critical decisions by transforming and modeling data to align with business KPIs  
‚Ä¢ Implemented SAP BW/4HANA data provisioning and ETL processes, ensuring faster and more reliable data acquisition. Enhanced BI report performance, supporting the client's operational and strategic planning with accurate, timely data flows

## üß† Projects {#projects}

### üîç Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline _(Dec 2024 ‚Äì Jan 2025)_  
- Extracted and preprocessed text from PDF textbooks, formatted it into chunks and converted them into numerical embeddings  
- Designed a vector-based retrieval system to identify and extract relevant text chunks based on user queries  
- Generated context-aware prompts using retrieved passages and utilized LLM (Google/GEMMA-7B-it) to produce accurate, context-driven responses to queries derived from textbook content

### üöÄ Non-Self-Referential Attention in Transformers _(Jan 2024 ‚Äì May 2024)_  
- Explored modifications to Transformer architecture and developed a method called Non-Self-Referential Attention  
- Driven by the observation that self-attention values (main diagonal of the attention matrix) were often disproportionately high yet minimally informative, this method attenuated those values by a tunable factor to diversify attention distributions and improve performance on tasks like machine translation  
- Applied this approach to the 'en-pt' translation subset of the opus_books dataset, achieving a 2.12% BLEU score improvement
